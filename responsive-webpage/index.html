        <h3>How many research papers does Brazil produce?</h3>
        <p>Brazil was ranked 13th in the world in terms of its output of research papers between 2013 - 2018, just behind India (10th) and South Korea (12th), and ahead of Russia (15th) and South Africa (21st) (Figure 1). It is worth noting that despite changing economic conditions, the growth in Brazilian research output has been consistently strong over this six-year period.</p>
